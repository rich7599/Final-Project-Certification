# Final-Project-Certification

Project Name: Sandy's Pet Shop

Description:  This website was created as a final project in order to earn my certification in Web Applications Development.  The premise was to build a site for a fictitious small business known as Sandy's Pet Shop.  Please view the ReadMeScreenShots.docx at the bottom to see what the pages look like when rendered.  The website consists of the following pages:

"Home" page: This page lists sales and special products offered by the store.  

"Grooming" page: This page lists the various pet grooming packages and contains on online form to schedule a pet grooming appointment.  The grooming request form uses Javascript to validate the form.  The request form submits using PHP and the information is stored in a MySQL database.  There is also a backend admin page which can be used by the website administrator to view, edit, and delete each grooming request using embeded SQL SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries embedded in PHP code.

"Store Location" page:  This page contains directions to the pet shop and uses a Google Maps Embed API to display the pet shop's location. 

"About Us" page:  The page contains pictures and bios of the pet shop employees.

"Contact Us" page:  This pages displays a contact form that uses Javascript to validate the form content.  The form submits using AJAX and uses a JQuery library.  After submission, a PHP script creates an email and sends the email to the shop owner's email address.
 
The site contains a single header and footer which are displayed on each page using PHP.
