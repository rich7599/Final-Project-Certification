		<img src="Sandy.png" alt="Sandy" height="200" width="150">
		<p>Sandy's love for animals of all types led her to open her own pet store in the Summer of 2005.  After 12 years of working in coroporate America as an IT Systems Director, Sandy felt that there was more to life than the daily corporate grind.  Her passion for pets along with her extensive volunteer work at the Greater Birmingham Humane Society eventually led her to where she is today...and she LOVES it!!  That love shows daily through the attention to detail placed on her store.  The finest assortment of food, toys, treats, and other pet amenities is what sets Sandy's Pet Shop apart from all those big box pet store chains.</p>
