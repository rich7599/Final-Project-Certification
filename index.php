	<h2>We Now Feature Blue Buffalo Products</h2>

	<p>Treat your dog like family with Blue Buffalo, pet food made with natural, high quality ingredients. Made in the USA, Blue Buffalo pet foods balance essential nutrients and antioxidants to give your dog a holistically healthy diet. Six important nutrient classes (proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and water) serve your pet's growth and energy needs. All Blue Buffalo foods contain no chicken (or poultry) by-product meals, no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives, and no corn, wheat or soy. Keep your dog happy and healthy with Blue Buffalo. Enriched with LifeSource Bits (small dark kibbles enhanced with vitamins and minerals) and a "Super 7" blend of powerful antioxidant-rich ingredients, Life Protection Formula Adult Chicken and Brown Rice Recipe is made from chicken, whole grains, vegetables and fruit. The protein-rich chicken supports strong muscles while calcium and phosphorus maintain solid bones.</p>
